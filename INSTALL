This is C++ software and will need little more than cmake makee and the g++ compiler


If you're on raspbian make sure you're compilered up with:
sudo apt-get install build-essential

If you're on fedora you probably want more like
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ make cmake

Anyway, in this directory

1. cmake CMakeLists.txt

2. make

3. sudo make install

Hurrah, now you've got jfyspot installed and ready to go!

jfyspot -help might be handy...
